## 📚 Contents

### 1. Linear Regression
**Definition:**  
Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line.

**Use Case:**  
Predict continuous values like house prices or sales based on input features.

---

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
**Definition:**  
An extension of Linear Regression that uses two or more features to predict a continuous target.

**Use Case:**  
Predict prices based on area, location, and age of property.

---

### 3. Logistic Regression
**Definition:**  
A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic (sigmoid) function.

**Use Case:**  
Email spam detection, pass/fail prediction, churn prediction.
